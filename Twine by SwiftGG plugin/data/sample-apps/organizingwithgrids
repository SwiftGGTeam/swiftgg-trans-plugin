{"Organizing with Grids": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}, "Display visual content in an arrangement of rows and columns.": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}, "Welcome to the Organizing with Grids sample. This sample shows you how to arrange content using a grid view, and how to use a state variable to track the selection of a color in that grid.": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}, "Configuring the App": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}, "Learn the basics of building and configuring an app with SwiftUI.": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}, "Step 1": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}, "Before diving into the grid, take a look at how this code gets made into an app. Your ColorGridApp follows a set of guidelines created by the App protocol. This allows your project to run and behave just like any other app.": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}, "Step 2": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}, "The code marks ColorGridApp with @main, making it the entry point of the program — the code the app starts running first.": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}, "Step 3": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}, "When your app runs, it displays whatever content you place in the body property. Notice that this body creates the ContentView. When the app launches, it fills the screen with this view.": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}, "Step 4": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}, "When you create a new app, ContentView is configured as your top-level view by default. This is useful because you can go to ContentView to see how an app’s views are put together. However, this view can be renamed, so if you’re unsure what the top-level view of an app is, look here in the body property of the app definition.": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}, "Creating a Grid": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}, "Explore how to create and fill the grid view with colored rectangles.": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}, "This is the ContentView. It creates a grid of rounded rectangles, each a different color. ContentView is a View, so it can contain any number of other views inside of it. The grid is one of those views.": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}, "To populate the grid with different colors, you’ll use the allColors variable to store an array of color values. The grid iterates over this array and adds a rectangular button for each color in the array.": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}, "You’ll add any code that defines a view to the view’s body. You’ll define any variables that ContentView needs outside of its body.": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}, "The first view inside ContentView is a VStack, which arranges its views vertically, with some text above the grid.": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}, "Step 5": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}, "The grid might contain more items than it can display at one time, so the code wraps it in a ScrollView to scroll the content vertically, if necessary.": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}, "Step 6": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}, "Inside the ScrollView, you create a grid view using LazyVGrid. The grid is “lazy” because it doesn’t create its grid items until they are needed. LazyVGrid takes an argument for columns which determines how many columns show up in the grid.": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}, "Step 7": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}, "The value assigned to columnLayout specifies a three-column grid. You can change this value any time you want.": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}, "Step 8": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}, "Inside the LazyVGrid, you define each item for the grid to display. To do this, you use a ForEach loop to iterate over the allColors array. By using the color’s name as an identifier, ForEach can find the right element when it needs to update the color’s view.": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}, "Step 9": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}, "Each item in the grid is a Button view, and each button has an action (something that happens when you tap it), and a label (text or an image that tells people what the button does, like “Save” to save a file).": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}, "Step 10": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}, "The label for the button uses a RoundedRectangle view, and one of the colors from the ForEach loop. You can see this in the foregroundColor(color) modifer.": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}, "Using a State Variable": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}, "Investigate how SwiftUI changes the appearance of a view.": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}, "If you tap a color in the grid, you’ll notice that the text element on top of the grid changes color.": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}, "You add @State before a variable to tell SwiftUI to manage the storage for a value. When the value changes, SwiftUI updates any parts of the view that use the value. The state variable selectedColor tracks the most recently selected color, which the text at the top of the view uses for its foreground color.": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}, "The Text view uses selectedColor for its foreground color. Because selectedColor is a state variable, whenever the state changes, SwiftUI changes the color of this text.": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}, "When you tap a grid element, the selectedColor value changes to that element’s color, which also changes the color of the text.": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}, "Editing Grids": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}, "Let people edit data that your app displays.": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}}

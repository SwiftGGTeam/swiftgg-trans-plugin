{"Capturing video from Apple Vision Pro for 2D viewing": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}, "Record high-quality video of your visionOS app and its surroundings for app previews.": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}, "Overview": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}, "Use short videos and screenshots of your visionOS app to showcase your user interface, highlight functionality, and demonstrate usage. Help people understand what to expect from an immersive experience by recording content from the device that includes your app and its surroundings.": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}, "The system renders content with spacial effects and optimizations for viewing during immersive experiences. To produce high-resolution content for people to view on 2D displays, the system needs to render without these effects and drop some optimizations. Use Developer Capture in Reality Composer Pro to notify the system to reconfigure rendering, and capture up to 60 seconds of high-resolution video, including sound, from Apple Vision Pro.": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}, "Pair your Apple Vision Pro to Xcode": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}, "Before capturing video from your device, pair it to a Mac that has Xcode and the visionOS SDK installed. For instructions on pairing your device, see Running your app in Simulator or on a device.": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}, "Prepare to capture your app and its surroundings": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}, "Select a well-lit location that is free from clutter. Avoid including objects that might get in the way of your app‘s windows and 3D content or distract the audience. Include enough detail in the scene to provide context and anchoring points. Consider your surroundings and avoid material that you don’t have permission to capture. This can include people, screens, branded products, logos, artwork, and other intellectual property.": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}, "Use the version of your app that you intend to share with your audience. Build and install your app using a release configuration. This configuration enables code optimizations for better runtime performance and disables the generation of debugging information. Debug configurations typically disable code optimizations and might include UI you donʼt intend to share. Don’t use them to record video for previews you intend to share. Build schemes manage the build configuration Xcode uses during build actions, for more information see Customizing the build schemes for a project.": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}, "Plan the tasks you intend to capture ahead of time and keep them short and focused. Launch the app and get the app into the state you need before you begin the capture. Reduce unnecessary processing overhead on the visionOS device by quiting other apps and avoiding background tasks.": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}, "Record your capture": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}, "To begin capturing video from the device:": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}, "Launch Reality Composer Pro. Choose Open Developer Tool > Reality Composer Pro from the Xcode menu.": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}, "Choose File > Developer Capture to bring up the Developer Capture dialog.": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}, "Select the device to capture from the pop-up menu.": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}, "If you see the message “Preparing, wait for the device to be ready”. You can click the info button that appears to the right of the popup menu for more information.": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}, "Click the record button to begin the countdown timer.": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}, "Clicking the record button starts a countdown. When the countdown reaches 0, the capture session begins. As the capture process happens, the video changes because the system reconfigures to render content for viewing in 2D. You might notice reduced responsiveness from the device during the session as it devotes more processing to render and capture the video.": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}, "Perform the interactions you want to record on the device. Keep relevant content centered and in frame. The aspect ratio of the video you capture crops content that appears at the sides of an experience. Keep your head stable, and use slow, steady movement to transition the focus of the device when necessary. Small movements get amplified and might be jarring to the audience.": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}, "Click the record button again from your Mac to end the capture session. The session ends on its own if the elapsed time exceeds 60 seconds.": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}, "Note": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}, "To begin a capture, the device must have a stable connection to your Mac and start at low power and thermal levels to stay below thresholds necessary to achieve consistent frame rates. When capturing multiple sessions, you might need to wait between each session.": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}, "Review the captured video file": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}, "Each recording session creates a QuickTime Movie file (.mov) and saves it to the desktop of your Mac. The file includes video captured at 30 FPS using 10-bit HEVC in HDTV Rec. 709 color space with system audio recorded in 32-bit floating-point linear PCM.": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}, "Review the video to make sure that it includes all the content you planned and it doesn’t include any unexpected elements. Ensure that the transitions and animations are smooth and frame rates are consistent.": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}, "You might want to use additional video-editing tools to trim, edit, and apply post-processing, such as stabilization, to the video to create a high-quality preview. Select frames from the video you capture to use as screenshots.": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}}

{"Configuring your app icon": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}, "Add app icon variations to represent your app in places such as Settings, search results, and the App Store.": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}, "Overview": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}, "Every app has a distinct app icon that communicates the app’s purpose and makes it easy to recognize throughout the system. Apps require multiple variations of the app icon to look great in different contexts. Xcode can help generate these variations for you using a single high-resolution image, or you can configure your app icon variations by using an app icon’s image set in your project’s asset catalog. visionOS and tvOS app icons are made up of multiple stacked image layers you configure in your project’s asset catalog.": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}, "Create an app icon": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}, "When you create your project from a template, it automatically includes a default asset catalog (Assets.xcassets) that contains the AppIcon.

Although using a single size is the default behavior for new apps or new icons in the asset catalog, you might need all sizes in order to include detail in larger variants and simplify as app size decreases.

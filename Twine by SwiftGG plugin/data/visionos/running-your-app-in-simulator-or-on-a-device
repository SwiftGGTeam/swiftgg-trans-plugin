{"Running your app in Simulator or on a device": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}, "Launch your app in a simulated iOS, tvOS, watchOS, or visionOS device, or on a device connected to a Mac.": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}, "Overview": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}, "To test your app, build and run it on a simulated or real device. Use simulated devices to debug your app on a variety of hardware to which you don’t have immediate access. The tradeoff is that simulated devices run within the Simulator app on your Mac and don’t replicate the performance or features of an actual device. To verify your app runs exactly as intended, run it on one or more real devices. You can connect a real device to your Mac using a cable, or for iOS, tvOS, or visionOS apps, connect it over Wi-Fi after you pair it with Xcode.": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}, "SwiftUI previews let you see your app’s interface without building and running your app. For more information on these dynamic previews, see Previews in Xcode.": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}, "Select a build scheme and run destination": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}, "Before you build and run your app, select a build scheme that includes the target for your app. A scheme is a collection of project details and settings that tell Xcode how to build and run a product from your project. Xcode determines where the resulting product can run based on the scheme you select, and populates the run destination menu in the toolbar with the list of available devices. For example, if the scheme contains a tvOS app, Xcode includes only tvOS simulators and devices as potential run destinations.": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}, "To learn more about schemes, see Customizing the build schemes for a project.": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}, "Important": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}, "When running apps in Simulator, some hardware-specific features might not be available. Frameworks that provide access to device-specific features also provide API to tell you when those features are available. Call those APIs and handle the case where a feature isn’t available. To test the feature itself, run your code on a real device.": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}, "Configure the list of simulated devices": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}, "Manage real and simulated devices in the Devices and Simulators window in Xcode.

The Devices tab shows the currently connected and disconnected devices and can help you diagnose problems that might occur. For example, Xcode might show a device as unavailable if it’s not running an operating system version your app supports. It also shows new devices available for pairing with your Xcode installation. Pair a device with Xcode to include them in the list of run destinations for your projects.": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}, "To pair a device with a physical connection, connect the device to your Mac using an appropriate cable.

After this step, follow any instructions on the Apple Watch to trust the Mac. When paired through an iPhone running iOS 17 or later, Xcode connects to the Apple Watch over Wi-Fi. Series 5 and older models of Apple Watch additionally require the Apple Watch and Mac to be associated with the same Bonjour-compatible Wi-Fi network. When paired through an iPhone running older versions of iOS, Xcode requires the iPhone to remain connected to the Mac in order to develop on any model of Apple Watch.": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}, "Before installing your app, perform a few additional steps:": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}, "Specify your Apple ID in the Account preferences in Xcode.": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}, "Specify a valid team in your project’s Signing & Capabilities pane.": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}, "Code sign your macOS app if it includes capabilities that require code signing; see Adding capabilities to your app.": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}, "Register the device with your team if you belong to the Apple Developer Program.": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}, "Enable Developer Mode on an iOS, watchOS, or visionOS device, as described in Enabling Developer Mode on a device.": {"zh": "", "tips": ""}, "You don’t need to configure a Mac device to run your macOS apps.
